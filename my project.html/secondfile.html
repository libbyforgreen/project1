	   <p><strong>"Graduated from High School in the Bronx in 1998. In Ireland, I have attended the College of Commerce and obtained the Level 5 certificate for Police and Security and the Level 6 certificate was for Advanced Business. Currently I am in my 1st of a 4-year degree in BIS, (Business Information Systems). In this course, I am studying modules that involve Coding, Programming and knowledge of Internet Development. After I obtain my degree, I work to begin a career a management field. I realise however, that in any direction I go in, I will always be building up my educational skills as there is always more that I can learn."
