		<p><strong>"My past work expierence consists mainly of working as a Bartender in various bars, pubs and Hotels. However, before that I have worked in the Retail Industry from High end shops such as Barneys New York to the more late 90's to early 2000's trend setting shops like the Yellow Rat Bastard. Working in such social enviorments have afforded the opportunity to network and thus meet people who would eventually lead me onto the path of travel, which can seem easy enough in New York City. 
		 When I moved to California, I continued to Bartend but I met several people who were encouraging me to work abroad. After a few years I moved to Austrialia via France, where I worked in the Hospitality Industry. I hosted and Bartended in a 4 star Hotel called "The Vault." My time in Austrailia was amazing and I had the option to renew my visa but I wanted to move on. Finally, I landed on Irelands shores and it was here where I had decided to continue my education so that many more doors would be open to me.</strong></p>
